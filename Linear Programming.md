Linear programming is the act fo representing a system as a system of linear equation and then solving for the system in order to *minimize* or *maximize* for some answer.

## Formalism
A linear programming model has a few elements to it, the decision variables, some sort of linear constraint, and some function. 

## Constraint Graph
Typically, a linear model could be visualized with some sort of constraint graph, which shows the intersection between linear equations, but that has its limitations, notably as the number of variables increase.

## Issues
Runtime complexity is a common issue within linear programming, with certain classes of problems being harder to solve due to either data complexity or complexity space. The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a very common problem with very high runtime-complexity due to the constraints.
