There are simply too many different variables at play. As computational complexity increases, these problems have not become easier."

    "## Real World Motivations\n",
    "There aren't many currently available ground state estimators, and many of them are constrained to using already available basis sets (PyScf) or by the computational complexity of the simulation (Qiskit). Being able to accurately calculate the ground state energy of molecules in a short amount of time has applications in drug discovery, computational chemistry, and mateerial science. For many of these fields, chemical simulations is one of the biggest wasters of time, so speeding simulations up would mean saving time-related costs and computational resources."
